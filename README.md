# FunctionalReactiveAwesome

Here's my sample code from my AltConf 2015 talk, titled "[Functional Reactive Awesome](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/functional-reactive-awesome)". It discusses the benefits of functional reactive programming in the context of Swift using a still-nascent FRP framework. 

The goal here is that you pay attention to the _ideas_ and not the implementation. Who cares about implementation â€“ you can figure that out once you understand the importance of it. 

Pay attention to the "View Controllers" group in the Xcode project. 

Ignore everything else. It _does not matter_. 

The point is you see how cool writing code in functional reactive programming can be. Once you understand how powerful signals, transformations, and bindings can be, you can start to explore how to build these things yourself.
